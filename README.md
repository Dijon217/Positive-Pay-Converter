What is Positive pay? 
Positive pay is a service where an employer sends an electronic list of all paychecks to a bank so that the bank can confirm a deposited paycheck's authenticity. Multiple aspects of a check must align with the positive pay file for the check to be approved, such as the check number, amount, and account number.

How it Works:
1.	Export: Export your check register data from your accounting software as a CSV file.
2.	Convert: Use the Positive Pay Converter to transform the CSV file into the bank's required upload format.
3.	Upload: Easily upload the converted file to your bank's Positive Pay system.
